            <h1><strong>MS. CARLA EUNICE CAMPO BUITIZON</strong></h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Carla Eunice Buitizon, 19 years of age, and currently studying at Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. Back then, I've always dreamed of creating a space where people could gather, relax, and savor the perfect cup of coffee. So I decided to create this website as an extension of that dream, designed to bring my passion for coffee right to your screen. Here, you can explore our menu, learn about different beans, and even order your favorite drink.</p>

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
“A coffee talks in a Cafe”
      <br>
In our busy lives, we hardly have time for ourselves. We must wake up early in the morning, rush to the office, work there all day, and rush back home in the evening. In such a situation, giving yourself time for relaxation is very important. That is why it is recommended that you should go out once in a while and meet some new people. It will help you refresh your mind and soul and make new friends who can become your support system later on in life when you need them most. And how do we do this? By having coffee talks!
Coffee talks are an excellent way to connect with others over common interests such as movies or music while learning something new about each other’s lives that could come in handy later on.
